### Knowledge Bases   
- **[Linked Life Data](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/demoservices/linked-life-data/)**   
Linked Life Data is a data-as-a-service platform that provides access to 25 public biomedical databases through a single access point. The service allows writing of complex data analytical queries and answering complex bioinformatics questions. Simply navigate through the information, or export subsets such as ‘all approved drugs and their brand names’.
- **[Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html)**    
The UMLS, or Unified Medical Language System, is a set of files and software that brings together many health and biomedical vocabularies and standards to enable interoperability between computer systems.The UMLS integrates and distributes key terminology, classification and coding standards, and associated resources to promote creation of more effective and interoperable biomedical information systems and services, including electronic health records.  
- **[GENE ONTOLOGY](http://geneontology.org/)**  
The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase is the world’s largest source of information on the functions of genes. This knowledge is both human-readable and machine-readable, and is a foundation for computational analysis of large-scale molecular biology and genetics experiments in biomedical research.
- **[Health information technology (Health IT)](https://www.healthit.gov/)**   
Health information technology (Health IT) makes it possible for health care providers to better manage patient care through secure use and sharing of health information. Health IT includes the use of electronic health records (EHRs) instead of paper medical records to maintain people's health information.  
- **[National Center for Biotechnology Information(NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)**  
The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information.NCBI creates a variety of educational products including courses, workshops, webinars, training materials and documentation. NCBI educational events are free and open to everyone. All NCBI educational materials are available for anyone to re-use and distribute.  


### Knowledge Graphs  
- **[Knowledge Graph for Traditional Chinese Medicine](http://www.tcmkb.cn/kg/)**  
"Traditional Chinese Medicine Language System (TCMLS)" provides a relatively complete framework for constructing a knowledge map of TCM.TCMLS is a large-scale language system built on the technical concepts of ontology and semantic network. It has developed into a large-scale semantic network containing more than 100,000 TCM concepts and more than 1 million semantic relationships, which basically covers the concept system of TCM disciplines, and is in a leading position in the field of TCM in terms of scale and integrity. TCMLS essentially has a knowledge base structure, which can be naturally extended to a domain knowledge base by adding conceptual attributes.  
- **[Knowledge Graph of Breast Cancer (KGBC)](http://wasp.cs.vu.nl/BreastCancerKG/)**  
Knowledge Graph of Breast Cancer (KGBC) is a set of integrated knowledge/data sources concerning breast cancer. knowledge Graph of Breast Cancer provides the data infrastructure which can be used to explore the relationship among various knowledge/data sources of breast cancer and support for medical decision support systems. KGBC is represented with the format RDF/NTriple, a semantic web standard.  
- **[Knowledge graph of New Coronavirus](http://openkg.cn/group/coronavirus)**  
The new coronavirus health graph contains information on various diseases, drugs, symptoms, tests related to new crown pneumonia, and designated hospitals for receiving new crown pneumonia all over the country.  
- **[QA System on Medical Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/liuhuanyong/QASystemOnMedicalKG)**  
This project has completed from scratch, using a vertical website as a data source, and constructed a medical knowledge map centered on disease. The entity scale is 44,000, and the entity relationship scale is 300,000. Based on this, an automatic question answering system that can answer 18 types of questions has been established.
